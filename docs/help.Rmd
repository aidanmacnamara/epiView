epiChoose is an application for quantifying the relatedness between cell lines and primary cells. To get started straight away, choose the **Data Overview** and **Data Exploration** tabs. For some background, please read below ...

## Overview ##

In an effort to make choosing a cell line model for a particular cell type or biology a more data-driven decision, Open Targets have profiled a number of commonly used cell lines and relevant primary cells. The following assays have been used for this profiling:

- RNA-seq
- ChIP-seq (H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, CTCF)
- ATAC-seq
- SNP6

The cell lines and cell types that have been profiled have been sub-divided by tissue:

- Project 1 - Haematopoietic models: K562, KU812, MEG01, F36P, UT7, HEL9217
- Project 2 - Monocyte-macrophage differentiation models: THP-1 and U937 (with PMA/VD3/LPS stimulation)
- Project 3 - Lung models: A549 and BEAS-2B
- Project 4 - Liver models: HEP3B, HEPARG, HEPG2 (2D and 3D cultures)
- Project 5 - T-cell models: Jurkat and HUT-78 (+/- CD3 and CD28)
- Project 6 - B-cell models: Ramos, Toledo, Raji, ARH77, Namalwa

## Method ##

One of the goals of this project was to **integrate** across epigenetic and expression data to better understand relatedness between cell types and their potential cell line models. In order to perform this intergration, each data type had to be processed so the information across data types could be compared. The workflow above shows how this was performed for the epigenetic (non-expression) data:

1. For each data type (or mark), the cell lines and cell types to compare are chosen ...
2. Using the [signal file](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/bigWig.html) for that particular mark and cell, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is calculated across regions of interest (ROI).
3. When this is done across all cells of interest, a matrix is produced for that data type where each row is a cell type / cell line, each column is an ROI and the cells contain the AUC for that mark.
4. Hence, each datatype produces a matrix that can be compared and contrasted using further statistical and analysis techniques (e.g. PCA).
